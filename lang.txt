TOOLTIP ANNOTATION SYNTAX

A tooltip file is a plain text file with certain words annotated with tooltip 
data. The format of these annotations is  [:tooltip text|original content].

Labels should not be used across multiple lines, and they may not be reused or 
nested. To disambiguate, pipes, backslashes, and brackets within an annotation 
(in both the tooltip and content text) must be preceded with a backslash. The 
newline literal \n is supported within tooltip text only.

Newlines are respected, where a single newline is a line break and a double 
newline is a paragraph break.

See examples/example1.txt for a comprehensive example.
